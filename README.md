# Gametime!
## ZOMG Carlos’ RL FTW LFG App, WTG!

This is an app for getting a bunch of gamers together to game with.  Just set a game and a time (creative title right?) and wait for warriors, spartans, footballers, fellow zombie slayers to join up and play! It’s like the little girls from The Shining except on the internet, “Come play with us!”

_Technologies_:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Ruby on Rails
Bootstrap
